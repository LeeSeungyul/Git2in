Git2in

Git Repository Server

What is Git2in?

Git2in is a lightweight Git server focused on delivering two foundational values:

Accessible for all contributors
Forkable for every direction
Built for projects that deserve simplicity without compromise,
Git2in helps you own your code, your way.

The name stands for "Git + Two In" —
because it’s built with two principles inside, and ready for infinite outside uses.
